# files-java
This is the second Java project that I created. It has sqrt function, power function and +, -, *, / functions. It's sort of like a little calculator. It also has an usage section. 

The usage section has buttons. You'll see them when you run the code using Java directly or using either Eclipse, Netbeans or IntelliJ IDEA.
